# Airtable Linked Records Error Solution

## Problem
You're getting the error: `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN: Value is not an array of record IDs`. This error occurs when Airtable expects an array of record IDs for linked record fields, but receives a different format.

## Root Cause
In Airtable, linked record fields require special handling:
- They expect an array of record IDs (e.g., `["rec1234567890", "rec0987654321"]`)
- They cannot accept simple strings or other formats
- If your table has linked fields to other tables (like Notes, Tasks, etc.), they need to be formatted correctly

## Solution Implemented

The updated LeadService now handles this issue by:

1. **Multiple Error Handling Strategies**:
   - Detects `INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN` errors specifically
   - Falls back to minimal field creation when linked record issues occur
   - Provides graceful degradation instead of crashing

2. **Linked Record Field Detection**:
   - Checks if values look like record IDs
   - Avoids sending problematic values to linked record fields
   - Uses fallback strategies for complex field types

3. **Progressive Fallback Approach**:
   - First tries with all fields
   - If that fails due to field name issues, removes problematic fields
   - If that fails due to linked record issues, uses minimal fields

## How to Fix Permanently

### Option 1: Update Your Airtable Table Structure
1. Check your Leads table for linked record fields
2. If you don't need them, remove or rename these fields
3. Common linked fields might be:
   - Notes (linked to Notes table)
   - Tasks (linked to Tasks table)
   - Activities (linked to Activities table)

### Option 2: Properly Format Linked Record Values
If you need to keep linked record fields:
1. Send record IDs as arrays: `["rec1234567890"]` instead of `"rec1234567890"`
2. Ensure the record IDs exist in the linked table
3. Use the correct Airtable record ID format

## Testing the Solution

The updated code will now:
1. Try to create leads normally
2. If it fails due to linked record issues, automatically retry with fewer fields
3. Eventually succeed with at least the basic fields (Name, Email, Status)

This approach ensures your application continues to work even if there are table structure mismatches.
