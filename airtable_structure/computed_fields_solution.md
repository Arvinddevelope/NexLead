# Airtable Computed Fields Error Solution

## Problem
You're getting the error: `Field 'Created At' cannot accept a value because the field is computed`. This error occurs when the application tries to send values for computed fields in Airtable, which are automatically managed by Airtable and cannot accept manual values.

## Root Cause
In Airtable, certain fields are computed automatically and cannot accept values from API requests:
1. **Created At** - Automatically set when a record is created
2. **Updated At** - Automatically updated when a record is modified
3. **Auto-generated fields** - Fields with formulas or auto-generation rules

When the application sends values for these fields, Airtable rejects the request with an INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN error.

## Solution Implemented

The updated LeadService now handles this issue by:

1. **Removing Computed Fields from API Requests**:
   - Removed 'Created At' and 'Updated At' from all create and update requests
   - Airtable automatically manages these fields

2. **Updated All Create/Update Methods**:
   - Modified [createLead](file:///c:/Users/Arvind/Desktop/NextLead/nextlead/lib/data/services/lead_service.dart#L55-L110) method to exclude computed fields
   - Modified [updateLead](file:///c:/Users/Arvind/Desktop/NextLead/nextlead/lib/data/services/lead_service.dart#L112-L155) method to exclude computed fields
   - Updated all fallback methods to exclude computed fields

3. **Maintained Read Operations**:
   - Still reads computed fields when fetching records
   - Only prevents sending values to computed fields

## How the Fix Works

The updated LeadService now:

1. **Create Operations**:
   - Sends only user-provided fields
   - Lets Airtable automatically set 'Created At' and 'Updated At'

2. **Update Operations**:
   - Sends only updated fields
   - Lets Airtable automatically update 'Updated At'

3. **Read Operations**:
   - Continues to read all fields including computed ones
   - Properly parses computed field values

## Example Changes

### Before (Causing Error):
```dart
fields['Created At'] = lead.createdAt.toIso8601String();
fields['Updated At'] = lead.updatedAt.toIso8601String();
```

### After (Working Solution):
```dart
// Computed fields removed - Airtable handles them automatically
```

## Testing the Solution

The updated code will now:
1. Successfully create leads without computed field errors
2. Successfully update leads without computed field errors
3. Continue to read and display computed field values correctly
4. Maintain all existing functionality

This approach ensures your application works correctly with Airtable's computed fields while preserving all other functionality.
